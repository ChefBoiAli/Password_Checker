# Password_Checker
My first repository on GitHub. This is for a school project.

Project Plan: Password Strength Checker

Project Goals:
Develop a Python tool that checks the strength of passwords based on predefined criteria.
Provide feedback to users on the weaknesses and strengths of their passwords.
Enhance user awareness of password security and encourage the use of strong passwords.

Problem Statement:
Many users create weak passwords that are susceptible to brute-force attacks, dictionary attacks, and other forms of password guessing.
Weak passwords pose a significant security risk to individuals and organizations.
The goal is to create a tool that helps users assess the strength of their passwords and make informed decisions about their security.

Expected Outcomes and Deliverables:
A functional Python tool that analyzes passwords and provides feedback on their strength.
The tool will evaluate passwords based on predefined criteria, such as length, complexity, and the presence of common patterns or dictionary words.
The tool will generate clear and informative messages indicating the specific requirements that are not met if the password is weak.
The tool will provide positive feedback if the password meets the defined criteria for strength.
The tool will be user-friendly, with a simple command-line interface.

Week 1: Project Setup and Planning
Define project goals, scope, and deliverables.
Set up the project structure, version control, and necessary development environment.
Research and finalize the criteria for password strength assessment.

Week 2: Core Functionality Implementation
Implement the password strength-checking logic based on the predefined criteria.
Write test cases to ensure the accuracy of the strength assessment.
Validate the functionality against different types of passwords.

Week 3: User Interface and Feedback Generation
Design and implement a user-friendly command-line interface.
Generate clear and informative messages indicating the weaknesses and strengths of passwords.
Test the user interface and feedback generation for usability and clarity.

Week 4: Documentation, Final Testing, and Deployment
Write clear and concise documentation, including installation instructions and usage guidelines.
Perform comprehensive testing of the tool, including edge cases and error handling.
Revise and refine the tool based on user feedback and testing results.
Conduct a final review and refinement of the tool.
Prepare the tool for deployment, ensuring all dependencies and requirements are documented.
Package the tool for easy installation and distribution.
Release the tool on appropriate platforms or repositories.
